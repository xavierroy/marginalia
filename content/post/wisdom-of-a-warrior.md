Words can damage.  Silence can heal.  Knowing when to speak and when not to speak is the wisdom of sages.</p>


<p>Knowledge can hinder. Ignorance can liberate.  Knowing when to know and when not to know is the wisdom of prophets.</p>

<p>Unimpeded by words, silence, knowledge, or ignorance, a fluent blade cuts cleanly.  This is the wisdom of a warrior.
