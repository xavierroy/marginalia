The most fiendish of men, the most cowardly, none of them think of them as villains. They believe themselves to be heroes, accomplishing impossible tasks against overwhelming opposition.

They convince themselves of this by seeing only what they wish to see, robbing words of their message, forgetting the real and remembering the false. In this way, they are not so different from true heroes.

_What is the difference?_

True heroes are on our side.

Fiendish, cowardly, treacherous villains are the heroes of our enemies.
